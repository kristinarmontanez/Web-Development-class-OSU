    This is the style sheet to use for all content, I orinially had separate style sheets for each section, but
    soon realized that some styles were messing with other sections I did not intend to reach. 
    So I rolled all the css into one file.

Create a section for each top horizontal menu link that will take the user to each page.
Make sure that each "active" link is set aside to allow for differing CSS style/indication of which
page the user is currently on.

<!----------------------------------------Picture Carousel-------------------------------------------->
   
    
<!--
Here, I created a slideshow from the W3School's website. First, add the container, then the slides, 
picture by picture.
--> 
<div class="slideshow-container">
<div class="slideshow-inner">

<!--
Add each section for the carousel, and position each image, keeping with the same class. Place text
within each section for brief explanation of picture that will display as the picture displays. This basic 
idea was found on the "how-to" for slideshows on W3Schools. However, it needed to change pictures automatically,
so I added the automatic feature. Each slide has the fade feature in the class for transitioning, and 
has text on top of the picture.

--> 
    <div class="mySlides fade">
        <img src="white-rock-lakes-dome-peak-20180725_0386_focused.jpg"\

<!--
Add the side previous and next buttons, used thick arrow html icon code. Give them an "onclick"
feature that will move the slides either 1 (forward) or -1 (backward).

<!--
Add the dots at the bottom of the picture carousel, Give them an "onclick" feature and connect 
them to each picture/slide.

<div style='text-align: center;'>
    <span class="dot" onclick='currentSlide(1)'></span>
    <span class="dot" onclick='currentSlide(2)'></span>

<!--------------------------------------Header under the Carousel------------------------------------>

<!--
Create a header that will state general information about hiking outdoors. 
-->
<div class="centerstuff">
  <h2>There are so many hiking trails and waterfalls to visit in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. 
      Please take a look at a few you may already know, and some that deserve greater notoriety!</h2>
<!--
Citation to all pictures used in the picture carousel. As a side note, for some reason text will not position 
correctly when entered from the text.js file, so all text not repeating on each page will stay in each html file.
-->

         Link the url to the author/artist of the picture/media. This will be repeated throughout the pages
         copyright purposes. Also, create a "blank" target which will open in a new window, so that my 
         website will still be in a window to go back to.

<!--------------------------------------The Content Section----------------------------------------->

<!--
Here we will create a section where we divide the page into columns, the CSS will place the text and the
pictures next to each other instead of above and below. This helps to create a format that can be used over
and over again, and create continuity from page to page, this will also help with troubleshooting. The display 
idea is from the W3School's how-to on creating a responsive display. Column-66 gives a longer display width, and 
column-33 gives a shorter display width. 
-->    
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    <div class="column-66">
                <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Welcome to Paradise</b></h1>
                <h1 class="large-font" style="color:#004953;"><b>There's always time to find a new adventure</b></h1>
                <p>This blog site is inspired by many days of aimlessly wandering the outdoors with my dogs and discovering
                so many beautiful places. As part of a class project, I can now build my own blog page where I can collect information
                on hiking trails, lakes, waterfalls, and anything that helps you become one with nature. Please feel free to add 
                any information or new locations off the beaten path. I (and my dogs) will greatly appreciate it!</p>

        Here, create a zig-zag effect by placing the pictures in opposite margin spaces.

<!-----------------------------------------JAVASCRIPT------------------------------------------->
    
<!--
Javascript files for the carousel, scroll box, and repeatable text in the body of the pages. 
At first, I tried to place this at the bottom of the body, however, it would load with the pictures
not in slideshow form. So I placed the JS file right after the carousel portion of this page...
which made it worse. So here it stays.
