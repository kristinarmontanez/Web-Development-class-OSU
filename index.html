    This is the style sheet to use for all content, I orinially had separate style sheets for each section, but
    soon realized that some styles were messing with other sections I did not intend to reach. 
    So I rolled all the css into one file.

<!------------------------------------------Horizontal Menu------------------------------------------->
    

<!--
Create a section for each top horizontal menu link that will take the user to each page.
Make sure that each "active" link is set aside to allow for differing CSS style/indication of which
page the user is currently on.

<!------------------------------------Header Above Picture Carousel------------------------------------>    

<!--
Place the first large header, that will welcome users to the website. Give the span, along with every other
section needing text, a cereal ID that will be placed chronically with the text.js file. For example, "I3" 
stands for "Index" and "3rd" text string. This allows for easier changes and finding where text goes to each 
section. Several divs/headers have both a class, and an ID so that I can change the CSS styling separately 
from the javascript text.
--> 
<div class="big_letters" style="text-align:center">
    <h2>Explore the Northwest</h2>
</div>
  
    
    
    
<!----------------------------------------Picture Carousel-------------------------------------------->

<!--
Create a container for the slideshow.
--> 
<div class="slideshow-container">
<div class="slideshow-inner">

<!--
Add each section for the carousel, and position each image, keeping with the same class. Place text
within each section for brief explanation of picture that will display as the picture displays. This basic 
idea was found on the "how-to" for slideshows on W3Schools. However, it needed previous and next buttons.

    <div class="mySlides fade">
        <img src="white-rock-lakes-dome-peak-20180725_0386_focused.jpg"\

<!--
Add the side previous and next buttons, used thick arrow html icon code. Give them an "onclick"
feature that will move the slides either 1 or -1.

  <a class="prev" onclick='plusSlides(-1)'>&#10096;</a>
  <a class="next" onclick='plusSlides(1)'>&#10097;</a>
</div>
<br> 
<!--
Add the dots at the bottom of the picture carousel, Give them an "onclick" feature and connect 
them to each picture/slide.
-->
<div style='text-align: center;'>
    <span class="dot" onclick='currentSlide(1)'></span>
    <span class="dot" onclick='currentSlide(2)'></span>

<!--------------------------------------Header under the Carousel------------------------------------>

<!--
Create a header that will state general information about hiking outdoors. 
-->
<div class="centerstuff">
  <h2>There are so many hiking trails and waterfalls to visit in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. 
      Please take a look at a few you may already know, and some that deserve greater notoriety!</h2>
<!--
Citation to all pictures used in the picture carousel. For some reason it would not position correctly
when entered from the text.js file, so it will stay in the index.html file.

<!--------------------------------------The Content Section----------------------------------------->

<!--
Here we will create a section where we divide the page into columns, the CSS will place the text and the
pictures next to each other instead of above and below. These positions will be used repeatedly throughout
each page in order to avoide repeating code, and create continuity from page to page, this will also help 
with troubleshooting.

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    <div class="column-66">
                <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Welcome to Paradise</b></h1>
                <h1 class="large-font" style="color:#004953;"><b>There's always time to find a new adventure</b></h1>
                <p>This blog site is inspired by many days of aimlessly wandering the outdoors with my dogs and discovering
                so many beautiful places. As part of a class project, I can now build my own blog page where I can collect information
                on hiking trails, lakes, waterfalls, and anything that helps you become one with nature. Please feel free to add 
                any information or new locations off the beaten path. I (and my dogs) will greatly appreciate it!</p>

<!-----------------------------------------JAVASCRIPT------------------------------------------->
    
<!--
Javascript files for the carousel, scroll box, and repeatable text in the body of the pages. 
At first, I tried to place this at the bottom of the body, however, it would load with the pictures
not in slideshow form. So I placed the JS file right after the carousel portion of this page. 
...This made it worse. So here it stays.
