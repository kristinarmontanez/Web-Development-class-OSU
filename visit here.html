        <h1 class="large-font" style="color:#004953;"><b>My Favorite Spot</b></h1>
                <p>Ever since I was a child, my family has made this state
                park our family reunion spot. Silver Falls State Park has 10 beautiful waterfalls, 
                perfect for the whole family and has wheelchair access to most of the falls. 
                Enjoy a casual hike through a beautiful canyon in Oregon's largest State park 
                with beautiful waterfalls ranging in height from 27 feet to 178 feet and 4 of them 
                you can even walk behind. There are plenty of resting areas at each fall and the trail 
                is extremely well maintained.  The park itself is 9,000 acres and contains over 
                24 miles of trails for biking and hiking. The park also offers places to camp
                as well as cabins for rent.</p>

        <p>Consider this a must-do if you are in Seattle and feel like knocking out two amazing 
                    hikes AND getting to see a hidden lake all along US 2. The trail starts out 
                    on an old road with the typical amazing forest surrounding you. After roughly 
                    2miles the road will end and you can go right to Bridal Veil Falls or you can 
                    keep going and go straight to Lake Serene. This is where I would suggest going 
                    up to Bridal Veil since it's only an extra mile and totally worth it. Plus 
                    there's nothing like swimming under a waterfall.</p>

    <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Twin Falls-North Bend, Washington</b></h1>
    <h1 class="large-font" style="color:#004953;"><b>absolutely Stunning</b></h1>
        <p>Head out on this quick 3-mile round-trip trail to take in this 70ft waterfall. 
                    Give the legs a little workout with the 500ft elevation gain. Get there early on 
                    the weekends to get a parking spot close to the trailhead. Duration: 2 hours.
                    For a portion of this 3-mile hike, you'll trek next to the South Fork Snoqualmie 
                    River, so take in the peaceful sound of the river running. Along the trail runs a 
                    river, where massive boulders create wading pools of icy water for warm summer 
                    days. At 1.5 miles, you'll reach a viewpoint bridge, which provides you with a 
                    great view of both the upper and lower falls.</p>
