                <p>We live in the beautiful state of Washington, where we enjoy hiking opportunities
                just about anywhere we go! First, meet Luna. She’s a husky-lab-rotty mix. She’s often 
                grumpy but is always in a good mood when we spend the day outdoors. The little white 
                husky is Inlé. She is spunky, loving, and has very strong opinions on…well…just about 
                everything. Their favorite hiking spots include any place that they can
                possibly find treasures to sniff out and carry home with them. I have an ever-growing 
                pile of "fetch sticks" brought home that serve as trophies of hikes past.</p>
            <img src="out hiking.jpg" class="content_image" style="margin-top: 60px" alt="App" width="335" height="430">
                <p style="margin-top: 50px">During our hikes, we have encountered many types of wildlife, 
                including black bears, mountain lions, moose and elk. To be fair, we lived in Alaska for a time, 
                and it’s hard to go outside without passing a moose at some point. When hiking in the wilderness, 
                make sure to always tell someone where you are going and your estimated time of return. 
                If you are able, protect yourself and your fur babies by keeping to the designated trail, 
                hiking only during daylight, and always keep a form of protection with you such as pepper 
                spray to ward off bears and larger animals. And even if you are in comfortable temperatures, 
                it’s always wise to bring extra layers of clothing just in case! If you love hiking as much as we do,
