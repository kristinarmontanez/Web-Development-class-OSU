                <p>We live in the beautiful state of Washington, where we enjoy hiking opportunities
                just about anywhere we go! First, meet Luna. She’s a husky-lab-rotty mix. She’s often 
                grumpy but is always in a good mood when we spend the day outdoors. The little white 
                husky is Inlé. She is spunky, loving, and has very strong opinions on…well…just about 
                everything. Their favorite hiking spots include any place that they can
                possibly find treasures to sniff out and carry home with them. I have an ever-growing 
                pile of "fetch sticks" brought home that serve as trophies of hikes past.</p>
            <img src="out hiking.jpg" class="content_image" style="margin-top: 60px; margin-left: 60px" 
            alt="App" width="335" height="430">
                <p style="margin-top: 50px">During our hikes, we have encountered many types of wildlife, 
                including black bears, mountain lions, moose and elk. To be fair, we lived in Alaska for a time, 
                and it’s hard to go outside without passing a moose at some point. When hiking in the wilderness, 
                make sure to always tell someone where you are going and your estimated time of return. 
                If you are able, protect yourself and your fur babies by keeping to the designated trail, 
                hiking only during daylight, and always keep a form of protection with you such as pepper 
                spray to ward off bears and larger animals. And even if you are in comfortable temperatures, 
                it’s always wise to bring extra layers of clothing just in case! If you love hiking as much as we do,

Create the required scrollbar function. 
Here, per the Piazza comment from the instructor, we had to create a manual scroll bar. This was hard to figure out, 
but I found pure html/JS version of it here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27322881/how-can-i-create-a-simple-
page-vertical-scroll-bar-without-using-jquery. More explanation of how it works in the JS file provided.

                    <p>First, you're going to want to get yourself a good water container. For yourself, and if you 
                    are a fur-baby parent, for your pups too. I would suggest a container that is made of metal 
                    incase you drop it. Metal containers also keep cold longer. The water container I like is the Yeti
                        Rambler. It's easily portable and easy to open. <b>Click on the image</b> to find out where to get this Yeti Rambler</p>

                    <p>And last, it's always good to carry a medical kit with you, just in case you get hurt, or your pup gets hurt. These 
                    medical kits are great because they are light and include the most common things you'll need. Don't forget to grab
                    some liquid bandage for your pup for better adhesion to their skin. <b>Click on the image</b> to find out where to get
